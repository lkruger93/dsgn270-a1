# Jameson's pubs' wonderful website
## Visual Hierarchy

Jameson's site visuals are quite straightforward and simple but creates a welcoming and open design.  Through use of concepts such as *negative space* in all places where content is not necessary it makes it feel simple but effective.  The use of colours such as blue with a white background make any icons stand out much more.

Of course, it is immediately obvious to note the *Z-pattern*, where users will quickly see the top bar with the logo on the left and a drop down list on the right followed very soon by a slideshow of images directly underneath.  Directly beneath the slideshow, there are 4 icons with captions directly underneath:

  1. Hungry?
  1. Thirsty?
  1. Sports fanatic?
  1. Having a party?
  
  >We strive to provide you with delicious quality comfort food that goes far beyond basic pub fare and boasts a variety of modern delights and traditional Irish food, which is made from scratch and local suppliers are used wherever possible.
  
Conveniently, each caption has a short description underneath that gives a brief overview of what the caption mentions.  The overall goal of the website is to educate viewers on what food they have and the benefits of going there.  This is easily realized as the icons are all clickable and send the users to pages that each caption mentions, namely:
 
  + Their main menu for "hungry?"
  + Their drink menu for "thirsty?"
  + Their events page for "sports fanatic?"
  + Their reservations page for "having a party?"
  
  The website definitely makes effective use of visual hierarchy as it immediately draws the users' eyes to their food and drinks, which are the main service of the restaurant, before giving more information in the form of text and menus.
 ## Mental Models and Usability
The conventions of design of the website seem to be followed with no violations.  The content, while scannable, *lacks much drastic font size differences*, and it's not always clear what the most important part of the website excluding the images are.  To know much about any one thing a user would likely have to read **most of the information underneath** to find out if one was only searching for one detail.

Another issue is that when navigating past the first page **it is unclear what page is on the screen until it is scrolled down**, as a slideshow of images takes up the whole screen initially.  I would likely change that by putting the title of the page at the top above the image, or make the image smaller so it can be seen immediately.
>Home of quality comfort food

Overall, the body text is quite readable, with all the content in the main body of each page on a white background with dark text so the contrast is quite clear. Towards the bottom on the main page, the restaurant's hours on each day of the week are displayed with white text on a picture background, but the background is dark enough that it too is easy to see. 
  
## Mobile Responsiveness
The website overall is quite responsive on all platforms, but very good on mobile.  There is a scroll track and overall it looks almost identical to how it looks on a large screen, but in a more condensed form for the images.  There is a drop-down mobile menu, with 4 pages:

  1. Daily features
  1. Menu
  1. Drink menu
  1. Take-out menu
 
 The online menu is responsive and shows different items based on what is tapped, but there is **no QR code for it to be bookmarked later**.  However, it does feature a *downloadable menu* that can be opened in a separate browser.
## Accessibility
The website overall is simple and open enough that it should be accessible for most people.  The clear text is easy for most people and text readers to read and when zoomed it doesn't lose quality.  Overall most people could likely use this website with few problems.
### Conclusion
Overall Jameson's website can be seen as a success.  It ticks all boxes and is overall pleasant to experience.  The average user would likely consider this website to be successful in granting them what they are looking to find and likely contributes to the restaurant's success.
